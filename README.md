This plugin allows swift development of Armagetron Advanced servers.

Any command from the game can be added very easily by extending the event class you wish to use. I am going to implement a more advanced way of organizing these commands in the future, possibly by server revision (Sty ct, etc.) The parameters you enter will be how the program will parse the armagetron input, so please verify that the type you request is actually what the game will output!

Example Coming Soon...
